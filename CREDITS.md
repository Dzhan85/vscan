# Starting Point
The original class for this project was taken from [Reconnoitre](https://github.com/codingo/Reconnoitre) which adapted virtual host discovery code from [teknogeek's virtual-host-scan](https://github.com/teknogeek/virtual-host-discovery-py).

This in turn was adapted from [jobertabma's virtual-host-discovery](https://github.com/jobertabma/virtual-host-discovery).

# Wordlist
Wordlist was expanded with data from the NMAP http-vhosts nse script wordlist found in /data/vhosts-default.lst.
